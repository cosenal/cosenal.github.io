The .pdf version of the résumé is generated with John MacFarlane's awesome tool 
[Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/).

The Crane icon is designed by [Kenneth Von Alt](http://www.thenounproject.com/KenVonAlt) from the 
[Noun Project](http://www.thenounproject.com).

The layout of the resume page is inspired by Parker Moore's [personal page](https://byparker.com)
