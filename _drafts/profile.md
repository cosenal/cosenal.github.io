Research Interests
==================

My research is in _theoretical computer science_ and, more specifically, in the field of _quantum computing_.  

I am particularly interested in questions regarding quantum information theory, quantum query complexity and
structural complexity theory.  

Specific problems include: local distinguishability of quantum states, 
oracle complexity, limitations of small-depth circuits, applications of 
convex programming to quantum information theory.


Programming Skills
==================

For my research, I mostly code in the 
MATLAB/Octave language and I use the [CVX](http://cvxr.com/) package for _convex programming_.

When I program for fun, I try to write software that is useful for other people and unrelated to my research.
I identify myself in the following quote by [Scott Aarsonson](http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1981):

> If I hadnâ€™t gravitated to the extreme theoretical end of computer science, I think I might have gone instead to 
> the extreme practical end, rather than to any of the points in between.

I started as a Java/C++ coder, but lately I have transitioned to _web development_ 
and I am mostly experienced with PHP server-side and JavaScript client-side.
