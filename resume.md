Research Interests
==================

My research is in _theoretical computer science_ and, more specifically, in the field of _quantum computing_.  

I am particularly interested in questions regarding quantum information theory, quantum query complexity and
structural complexity theory.  

Specific problems include: local distinguishability of quantum states, 
oracle complexity, limitations of small-depth circuits, applications of 
convex programming to quantum information theory.


Programming Skills
==================

For my research, I mostly code in the 
MATLAB/Octave language and I use the [CVX](http://cvxr.com/) package for _convex programming_.

When I program for fun, I try to write software that is useful for other people and unrelated to my research.
I identify myself in the following quote by [Scott Aarsonson](http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1981):

> If I hadn’t gravitated to the extreme theoretical end of computer science, I think I might have gone instead to 
> the extreme practical end, rather than to any of the points in between.

I started as a Java/C++ coder, but lately I have transitioned to _web development_ 
and I am mostly experienced with PHP server-side and JavaScript client-side.

Work Experience
===============


Google Summer of Code student developer
---------------------------------------

_Organization: KDE_  
_Summer '12_

Under the mentorship of Jakob Sack, I created the [ownCloud News](https://github.com/owncloud/news) app, 
a feed reader for [ownCloud](http://owncloud.org/). The app is among the highest rated apps on the 
ownCloud App store. I am still involved in the project, but currently it is most actively maintained by 
[Bernhard Posselt](https://github.com/Raydiation).     

UNIX Consultant
---------------

_Math Faculty Computing Facility, University of Waterloo_  
_Winter '12_, _Fall '12_

Assisting students, faculty and staff with computer related problems, both in person and 
on the help-desk newsgroup.
    

Season of KDE student developer
-------------------------------

_Summer '11_

Participated with the _KDE PIM_ team, under the mentorship of Frank Osterfeld,
working on Akregator, the feed reader shipped with KDE.
I built an [Akonadi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akonadi) resource to store feeds locally.

Programmer
----------

_Department of Computer Science, University of Pisa_  
_Summer '07_

Designing and implementing a software to map tutors and students for internships at 
the Department of Computer Science.

Other Experience
================

[Outreach Program for Women][opw] mentor and org coordinator
------------------------------------------------------

_Organization: ownCloud_  
_Summer '14_   
    
I mentored the applicant Lyndsey Jane Moulds with the project of
building a Firefox OS app that uploads pictures taken from the phone camera to ownCloud. 

Together with Jan-Christoph Borchardt, I coordinated the first participation of ownCloud
at OPW.


Teaching assistant
------------------

_University of Waterloo_  
_2010 -- 2013_

Courses: 

*   Theory of Quantum Information (graduate course)

[Google Code-in][codein] org administrator
------------------------------------------

_Organization: KDE_  
_2012_  

I helped Teo Mrnjavac and Lydia Pintscher with admin jobs. This included: approving new tasks, 
helping students with questions, watching students' requests and forwarding them to the mentors.


Exchange programs
=================

Research intern
---------------

_LIAFA, Université Paris Diderot_  
_February '13 -- April '13_

I worked with Prof. Frédéric Magniez on a problem in quantum query complexity.

While at LIAFA, I helped with the organization and I was a speaker of a mini-course 
on semidefinite programming in quantum information.


Exchange student
----------------

_Aarhus University_  
_September '07 -- March '08_

Under the [_Erasmus program_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus_Programme) 
at the Department of Computer Science.
