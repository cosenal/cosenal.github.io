Summary
=======

Graduated in August 2015 with a PhD in Computer Science, I am looking for a job in the tech industry.

Thanks to a specialization in quantum information, I have acquired strong mathematical (especially, linear algebra and convex optimization) and analytical skills, which I am seeking to apply to a job in the data science field.

My background is fully in computer science, with a particular focus on theoretical fundamentals (algorithms and data structures) and machine learning.

I also have hands-on experience with full-stack web development obtained through involvement in different open source projects.
